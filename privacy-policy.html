         <h1>Privacy policy</h1>

         <h2>Personal data protection</h2>
         <p>
            The CDS-R is committed to user privacy.
         </p>
         <p>
            The policy on protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions is based on Regulation (CDS-R) 
            2023 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Solidarity.
         </p>
         <p>
            This general policy covers the CDS-R website, within the CDS-R domain. Although you can browse through most of these websites without giving any personal information, in some cases information is required in order to provide the e-services you request. Websites that require such information treat it in full compliance with the regulation mentioned above and provide information about the use of your data in their specific privacy policy statements.
         </p>
         <h2>Information contained in a specific privacy statement</h2>
         <p>
            A specific privacy policy statement will contain the following information about the use of your data.
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>
               what information is collected, for what purpose and the technical means by which the CDS-R collects personal information in order to fulfil a specific purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
               to whom your information is disclosed.
            </li>
            <li>
               how you can access your information, verify its accuracy and, if necessary, correct it.
            </li>
            <li>
               how long your data is kept.
            </li>
            <li>
               what security measures are taken to safeguard your information against possible misuse or unauthorized access.
            </li>
            <li>
               whom to contact if you have queries or complaints.
            </li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Contacting CDS-R site</h2>
         <p>
            Many web pages on CDS-R have a contact numbers or emails, which ask your e-mail  and invites you to send your comments to a specific mailbox.
            When you send such a message, your personal data is collected only to the extent necessary to reply. If the management team of the mailbox is unable to answer your question, it will forward your e-mail to another service. You will be informed, via e-mail, about which service your question has been forwarded to.
         </p>

         <h2>Safeguarding information</h2>
         <p>
            Collected personal data is stored on a computer of the external subcontractor acting as processor, who must guarantee the data protection and confidentiality required by Regulation (CDS-R) 2023.
         </p>

         <h2>Verifying, modifying or deleting information</h2>
         <p>
            If you want to verify, modify or delete your personal data stored by the responsible controllers for the CDS-R website and its managed by the CDS-R, you can use the emails provided in the website to write to the data controller for the CDS-R website. In the email, clearly state the nature of your request (verifying, modifying or deleting personal data published on the CDS-R websites).
         </p>
         
         
         <h1 id="cookie">Cookies Policy</h1>
         <h2>What's a cookie?</h2>
         <p>
            A "cookie" is a small file that is stored on your computer's hard drive and which records your
            navigation of a website (if you allow) so that, when you revisit that website, it can present tailored
            options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse
            traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes. <br>
            Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system. If you want to check or change
            what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings.
         </p>
         
         
         <h2>How do we use cookies?</h2>
         <p>
            We use cookies to: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Track your use of our website to compile aggregate data about site traffic and interaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remember preferences and information about you so you don’t have to provide it again.
                </li>
            </ul>
         </p>
         <p>
            This enables us to understand how you use the site and track any patterns that emerge. This helps us
            to develop and improve our website and services in response to what our visitors want and need.
         </p>
         
         
         <h2>There are different types of cookies:</h2>
         <p>
             <b>First party cookies:</b> these are set by the website you’re visiting and only that website can read them.
         </p>
         
         <p>
             <b>Third party cookies:</b> these are set by someone other than the website you’re visiting. Some website
                pages may feature content from other sites such as Twitter and YouTube which may have their own
                cookies. Sharing a website page on another service page e.g. Twitter may also set a cookie on your
                browser. 
         </p>
         
         <p>
             <b>Session cookies:</b> these are only stored on your computer during your web session and are
             automatically deleted when you close your browser – they usually store an anonymous session ID
             allowing you to browse a website without having to log in to each page but they do not collect any
             information from your computer.
         </p>
         
         
          <p>
             <b>Persistent cookies:</b> a persistent cookie is stored as a file on your computer and it remains there
             when you close your web browser. The cookie can be read by the website that created it when you
             visit that website again. We use persistent cookies for Google Analytics and for personalisation (see
             below).
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
             <b>Strictly necessary cookies:</b> These cookies are essential to enable you to use the website effectively,
             such as when applying for a job, and therefore cannot be turned off. Without these cookies, the
             services available to you on our website cannot be provided. These cookies do not gather
             information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you have been on
             the internet.
         </p>
         
         
          <p>
             <b>Performance cookies:</b> These cookies enable us to monitor and improve the performance of our
             website. For example, they allow us to count visits, identify traffic sources and see which parts of the
             site are most popular.
         </p>
         
         
          <p>
             <b>Functionality cookies:</b> These cookies allow our website to remember choices you make (such as your
             user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features. For instance, we may
             be able to provide you with news or updates relevant to the services you use. These cookies can also
             be used to remember changes you have made to text size, font and other parts of web pages that
             you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have requested such as viewing a
             video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is usually anonymised.
         </p>
         
         
          <p>
             <b>How long do cookies last?</b> Some cookies are removed when you finish your session and exit the browser. Others are more longterm, sometimes indefinite, 
             and are saved onto your device so they’re there when you return to the
             website. 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>
             <b>How to reject cookies</b> You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose
             to turn off all cookies if you don’t want to receive cookies that are not strictly necessary to perform
             basic features of our site. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to
             learn how to change your cookie preferences. <br>
             If you disable cookies, some of the features that make your site more efficient, may not function
             properly. <br>
             Cookies can be disabled at any time, even if you have previously accepted them. <br>
             For more information generally on cookies, including how to disable them, please refer to
             aboutcookies.org. You will also find details on how to delete cookies from your computer.
